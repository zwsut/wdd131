if statement: Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
else statement: Provides an alternative block of code to execute if the condition in the if statement is false.
else if statement: This structure allows for the checking of multiple conditions in sequence

if (condition) {
    stuff to do
} else if (condition2) {
    other stuff
} else {
    other stuff
}

Switch Statements: Provides a way to execute selective blocks of code based on the value of an expression.

switch (expression)
    case value1:
        code to run
        break
    case value2:
        code to run
        break
    
    ...

    default:
        code if none of the values match

Loops
for Loop: Repeats a block of coe a specified number of times.

for (let i = 0; i < 19; i++) {
    code to run
}

while Loop: Repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

while (condition) {
    code to run
}

forEach Loop: This loop structure is for arrays. It iterates over each element of the array.

array.forEach(function(element) {
    runs function on each item in array
})
